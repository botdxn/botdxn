## My cool repos (some of 'em are poorly documented but believe me I'll start doing that properly lmao)
 - [Youtube Mp3 GUI](https://github.com/dixone23/python-youtube-mp3) - first try at PyQT5 to create a simple youtube-to-mp3 downloader
 - [OLX API Scraper](https://github.com/dixone23/olx-api-scraper) - my first bigger project using FastAPI and BeautifulSoup to scrape offers from Polish website. Also it serves as a platform to learn basic CI/CD operations (Github Actions) along with structuring projects for builds and releases.
 - [PythonDesktopCleaner](https://github.com/dixone23/PythonDesktopCleaner) - implementation of an idea from a YouTuber Kalle Hallden where the script categorizes and cleans out your desktop (or any given path for that matter)
 - [PyCryptor](https://github.com/dixone23/PyCryptor) - simple script to safely encrypt your files with a safe-key that you will have to save in order to not lose your hentai
 - [universal-forms-submitter](https://github.com/dixone23/universal-forms-submitter) - a work-in-progress script to automatically fill out Google Forms (without text answers yet)

## Future ideas
- SEO Analyzer: plugging in URL for a website (probably a static one at first) will result in a huge analysis of its' SEO indicators (alongside with trendy "technical SEO")
- Gmail Debloater: removing spam from Google inbox and doing some under-the-hood analysis of the headers (maybe against Virustotal database or CERT.pl list of dangerous domains) - parts of the work already started (see: "virustotal_checker")
... more to come
