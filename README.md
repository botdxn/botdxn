## Hello fellow Pythoners!
My name is Marcin and I mostly write Python scripts to automate my daily stuff or whenever I find some cool idea on the internet. I love webscraping data from various websites so naturally **Selenium**, **Scrapy** and **BeautifulSoup** are my best friends 😄

I currently study at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology and it's ~~terrible~~ amazing. Apart from all the things I already told you I recently fell in love with Capture the Flag competitions where I have to apply some of the Python knowledge to speed up some tasks or gain valuable intel.

## My cool repos
 - [PythonDesktopCleaner](https://github.com/dixone23/PythonDesktopCleaner) - implementation of an idea from a YouTuber Kalle Hallden where the script categorizes and cleans out your desktop (or any given path for that matter)
 - [PyCryptor](https://github.com/dixone23/PyCryptor) - simple script to safely encrypt your files with a safe-key that you will have to save in order to not lose your hentai
 - [universal-forms-submitter](https://github.com/dixone23/universal-forms-submitter) - a work-in-progress script to automatically fill out Google Forms (without text answers yet)

I also have in plans to write a bigger application to automatically scrape and monitor job offers for various sites for my Masters' Degree project.
